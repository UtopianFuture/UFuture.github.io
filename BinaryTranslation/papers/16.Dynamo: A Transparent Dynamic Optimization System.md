## Dynamo: A Transparent Dynamic Optimization System

### 1. introduction

Dynamo is a software **dynamic optimization system** that is capable of transparently **improving the performance** of a native instruction stream as it executes on the processor.

The use of object-oriented languages and techniques in modern software development has resulted in a greater degree of delayed binding, limiting the size of the scope available for static compiler analysis. Shrink-wrapped software is being shipped as a collection of DLLs rather than a single monolithic executable, making whole-program optimization at static compile-time virtually impossible.

The Dynamo can **complement the static compiler’s** traditional strength as static performance improvement tool with a dynamic performance improvement capability.

### 2. overview

Dynamo only interprets the instruction stream until a “hot” instruction sequence(or *trace*) is identified. At that point, Dynamo generates an optimized version of the trace(called a *fragment*) into a software code cache(called the *fragment cache*).

Assuming that the majority of an application’s execution time is typically spent in a small portion of  its code, the performance benefits form repeated reuse of the optimized fragments can be sufficient to offset the overhead of Dynamo’s operation.

### 3. Fragment Formation

There are two performance opportunities that Dynamo can use. There are generally redundancies that cross static program boundaries like procedure calls, returns, virtual function calls, indirect branches and dynamically linked function calls(**indirect or direct jump**). Another is **instruction cache utilization**.

#### 3.1. Trace Selection

Dynamo uses MRET (*for most recently executed tail*) to pick hot traces without doing any path or branch profiling. 

Dynamo associates a counter with certain selected start-of-trace points such as the target addresses of backward taken branches. The target of a backward taken branch is very likely to be a loop headers. And record the target of a backward taken branch is very likely to be a loop optimistically pick this sequence as a hot trace(**空间局部性**).

#### 3.2. Trace Optimization

Unconditional direct branches are removed. Some indirect branches are redundant can be removed, others are replaced with less expensive direct conditional branch.

### 4. Fragment Linking

Linking involves patching a fragment exit branch so that **its taken target is the entry point of another fragment**, instead of to its stub(类似与块链).

### 5. Fragment Cache Management

Dynamo cannot afford to do complicated management of the fragment cache storage, because of the overheads this would incur.

Dynamo instead employs a novel pre-emptive flushing heuristic to periodically remove cold trances from the fragment cache without incurring a high penalty.  A complete fragment cache flush is triggered whenever Dynamo recognizes **a sharp** **increase** in the fragment creation rate. This is likely indicative of **a significant change in the working set of the program** that is currently in the fragment cache.

### 6. Signal Handling

Dynamo **intercepts all signals** and executes the program’s signal handler code under its control. This give Dynamo an opportunity to **rectify the signal context** that would otherwise be passed directly to the application’s handler by the operating system.
