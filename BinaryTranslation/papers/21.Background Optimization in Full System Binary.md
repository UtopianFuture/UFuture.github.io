## LIntel: Background Optimization in Full System Binary Translation

The dynamic binary translation system **LIntel**, which provides full system-level binary compatibility with Intel IA-32 architecture on top of Elbrus(a VLIW microprocessor architecture) architecture hardware. To eliminate dynamic optimization overhead, Lintel perform optimization **simultaneously** with the execution, **in a separate thread**.

### 1. Adaptive binary translation

（1）LIntel follows adaptive, **profile-directed model** of translation and execution of binary codes. It includes **four levels of translation and optimization** varying by the efficiency of the resulting Elbrus code and the overhead implied, namely: interpreter, non-optimizing translator of traces and two optimizing translators of regions（O0, O1).

（2）Interpreter is normally dynamic translation with basic block; Non-optimizing translator of traces is construct *region*(block linking); and O0, O1 is optimize the basic block to product more effective code.

（3）Upon detecting a failure, retranslation of the region is launched applying more conservative assumptions depending on failure type.

### 2. Asynchronous interrupts handling

The full system translator need to handle incoming external (asynchronous) interrupts. The method of **delayed interrupt handling** allows to improve the performance of binary translated code execution and interrupt handling by specifying exactly where and when a pending interrupt can be handled. When interrupt occurs, interrupt handler only remembers this fact by setting corresponding bit in the processor state register and returns to execution. Interpreter checks

for pending interrupts before next instruction execution.

### 3. Execution and optimization threads

Execution thread activity includes **the entire process of translation** and **execution of original binary codes**, i.e.: interpretation, non-optimizing translation, run-time support and execution itself. Optimizing translator is run in a separate optimization thread when new region of hot code is identified by the execution thread. When optimization phase completes, generated translation of the region is **returned to the execution thread**, which places it into the translation cache.

### 4. 思考

4.1. 思想还是动静结合，不过用的是双线程，不适用于2个线程以上。这种设计能够用上，profile-oriented的想法。其他方面和之前的translator差不多。

4.2. 发生外部中断请求时，如果优化线程正在执行，记录中断信息，暂缓对中断请求的响应，先完成优化任务，在执行下一条命令前查询并响应中断请求。这里有个问题，如果是多核处理器，直接再用新的线程不就行了。
