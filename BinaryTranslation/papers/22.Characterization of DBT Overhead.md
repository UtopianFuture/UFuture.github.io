## Characterization of DBT Overhead

This paper analyzes the dynamic binary translator â€“ StarDBT performance and depict the main sources of overhead in details. It classifies the translation operations and associated overhead into **five major categories**, and **quantify** their contribution to the overall overhead.



### 1. Tracking the Overhead

To analyze the sources of overhead, we break the DBT functionality in five main operations: *initialization*, *cold code translation*, *code profiling*, *hot trace building*(using the MRET approach) and *translated code execution*.
