## The Transmeta Code Morphing Software

Transmeta’s Crusoe is a VLIW microprocessor, but it uses the Code Morphing Software (CMS) support full, system-level implementation of the x86 architecture. CMS combines an interpreter, dynamic binary translator, optimizer, and run-time system.

### 1. CMS structure

CMS is structured like many other dynamic translation systems. Initially, an **interpreter** decodes and executes x86 instructions sequentially, with careful attention to memory access ordering and precise reproduction of faults, while **collecting data** on execution frequency, branch directions, and memory-mapped I/O operations. When the number of executions of a section of x86 code **reaches a certain threshold**, its address is passed to the **translator**.

The translator selects a region including that address, **produces native code** to implement the x86 code from the region identified, and stores the translation with various related information in **the translation cache**. From then on, until something invalidates the translation cache entry, CMS executes the translation when the x86 flow of control reaches the translated x86 code region.

once the branch target is identified as another translation, the branch operation is modified to go directly there, a process called ***chaining***. Over time, therefore, frequently executed regions of code begin to execute entirely within the translation cache, without overhead from interpretation, translation, or even branch-target lookup.

### 2. the challenges

The subsection describe the challenges CMS meets by applying the procedure of speculation, recovery, and adaptive retranslation:

- CMS must faithfully **reproduce the precise exception behavior** of the x86 target, without overly constraining the scheduling of its translations.
- CMS must **respond to interrupts** at precise x86 instruction boundaries, where the system possesses a consistent target state.
- CMS must efficiently **handle memory-mapped I/O and other system-level operations**, without penalizing normal (non-I/O) memory references.
- Legacy PC software, especially games, often includes performance-critical **self-modifying code**.

#### 2.1 Hardware Support for Speculation and Recovery

Crusoe native VLIW processors provide an hardware solution that supports arbitrary kinds of speculation and subsequent recovery and works hand-in-hand with the Code Morphing Software.

All registers holding x86 state are **shadowed**; that is, there exist two copies of each register, a **working copy and a shadow copy**. Normal atoms only **update the working copy** of the register. If execution reaches the end of a translation, a special **commit** operation copies all working registers into their corresponding shadow registers, committing the work done in the translation. On the other hand, if any exceptional condition, such as the failure of one of CMS’s translation assumptions, occurs inside the translation, the runtime system undoes the effects of all molecules executed since the last commit via a **rollback** operation that copies the shadow register values (committed at the end of the previous translation) back into the working registers.

This mechanism is like the **reorder buffer(ROB)** and **reservations station**.
